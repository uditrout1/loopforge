## 6. Feature: Multi-Agent Workflow Engine

### FR-W-01: Workflow Definition
**Description:** Workflows are defined as directed graphs of nodes (agents, tools, conditions, human checkpoints) and edges.

**User Story:**
> As a developer, I want to define a multi-step AI workflow visually so I don't have to write orchestration code.

**Functional Requirements:**
- System shall support the following node types: Agent (executes an AI task), Tool (executes a deterministic function), Condition (branches based on output evaluation), Merge (waits for parallel branches and combines results), Human Checkpoint (pauses for human decision), Trigger (entry point)
- System shall support the following edge types: Sequential (A → B), Parallel fan-out (A → [B, C, D]), Conditional (A → B if X, A → C if Y)
- Each Agent node shall be configurable: model, context slice (keys from project brain), tools available, system prompt, retry strategy, timeout, output schema
- System shall provide a visual canvas editor for workflow construction
- System shall support workflow import/export as JSON
- System shall validate workflows before saving: no cycles (except explicit loop constructs), all edges connected, required node fields populated

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System shall write each node's output to the shared state store before executing the next node
- If the system restarts mid-workflow, execution shall resume from the last completed node
- System shall enforce timeouts per node; on timeout, apply the node's retry strategy
- Retry strategies: immediate retry (N times), exponential backoff, fallback to alternate model, fail and notify
- System shall stream workflow execution status via WebSocket: which node is running, which are complete, which are pending
- User shall see a live execution view on the workflow canvas: nodes animate as they execute

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Run a 5-node workflow; progress visible in real-time on canvas
- [ ] Kill the server mid-workflow; restart server; workflow resumes from correct node
- [ ] Node timeout triggers retry; second attempt succeeds; log shows both attempts
- [ ] Parallel nodes start simultaneously (verified by timestamp in logs)

---

### FR-W-03: Context Management Between Agents
**Description:** Each agent in a workflow receives exactly the context it needs — no more, no less.

**User Story:**
> As a developer building a workflow, I want each agent to have the right context for its task without receiving irrelevant information that wastes tokens.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Each Agent node shall declare a context slice: an array of keys from the project brain and shared workflow state to inject
- The orchestrator shall assemble the context for each agent from: declared context slice + outputs from predecessor nodes + relevant project brain chunks (semantic search on node's task description)
- Agent outputs shall be written to the shared state with a node-scoped key
- Context injection shall not exceed a configurable max token limit (default: 4000 tokens); if exceeded, summarize
- The orchestrator shall never pass the full conversation history between agents — only summaries and structured state

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Security agent in a PR Review workflow receives: changed files, not the full codebase
- [ ] Merge node receives outputs from all parallel agents in structured format
- [ ] Token count for agent context stays within configured limit

---

### FR-W-04: Human-in-the-Loop
**Description:** Workflows can pause at designated checkpoints awaiting a human decision before proceeding.

**User Story:**
> As a release manager, I want to approve a release after automated checks pass before the deployment proceeds.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Human Checkpoint node shall pause workflow execution indefinitely until resolved
- System shall send a notification (email + in-app) when a checkpoint is reached: what decision is needed, what the preceding agents determined, options available
- The notification shall include a link to a decision UI where the human can: approve (workflow continues), reject (workflow terminates), provide input (workflow continues with input injected into context)
- Checkpoint decisions shall be logged: who decided, what they decided, timestamp, any input provided
- Checkpoints shall expire after a configurable duration (default: 7 days); on expiry, workflow terminates with a notification

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Workflow reaches human checkpoint; email notification sent within 60 seconds
- [ ] Approving from notification link resumes workflow within 30 seconds
- [ ] Decision logged with approver identity and timestamp
- [ ] Workflow expires after configured duration; expiry notification sent

### FR-W-05: Built-In Workflow Library
**Description:** DevOS ships with a set of pre-built workflows covering common developer tasks.

**User Story:**
> As a developer, I want pre-built workflows for common tasks so I don't have to build everything from scratch.

**Built-In Workflows (V1):**

| Workflow | Trigger | Agents | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR Review | PR opened (webhook) | Security Agent + Code Review Agent + Coverage Agent (parallel) → Risk Scorer | PR comments + pass/fail status |
| Bug Investigation | Manual / ticket created | Reproducer → [Code Analysis + Log Analysis] → Fix Proposer → Verifier | Fix suggestion + PR |
| Feature Planning | Manual | Requirements Extractor → Complexity Estimator → Task Breakdown → Ticket Creator | Backlog tickets |

- [ ] Commit code that violates project naming convention; code review flags it
- [ ] Summary comment posted within 3 minutes of PR open
- [ ] PR cannot be merged when critical security finding exists (if blocking enabled)

---

### FR-CI-02: Testing Intelligence
**Description:** The system maps code changes to relevant tests and provides intelligent test execution recommendations.

**User Story:**
> As a developer, I want to run only the tests relevant to my changes so I get fast feedback without waiting for the full test suite.

**Functional Requirements:**
- System shall build a file-to-test mapping from the project brain: which test files cover which source files
- On PR open, system shall identify changed source files and recommend the corresponding test files to run
- System shall detect tests that have failed non-deterministically in the past 30 runs with no code change — flagging them as flaky
- Flaky tests shall be quarantined: excluded from blocking checks but still run and reported separately
- For source files with no corresponding test file, system shall generate 3 test case suggestions (not full test files — suggestions for the developer)
- System shall report: tests recommended, tests run, pass/fail, flaky tests excluded, coverage delta

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Change `SessionView.swift`; system recommends `SessionTests.swift` but not `VaultTests.swift`
- [ ] A test that failed 3 of last 10 runs with no code change is flagged as flaky
- [ ] Test generation suggests 3 test cases for an uncovered function, formatted as code comments

---

### FR-CI-03: Release Readiness Scoring
**Description:** Before every release, the system calculates a readiness score based on configurable criteria.

**User Story:**
> As a release manager, I want an objective readiness score before every release so the decision to ship is based on data, not gut feel.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Release readiness score shall be calculated from: test pass rate (weight: configurable), test coverage on changed files (weight: configurable), open critical/high tickets (weight: configurable), security scan result (weight: configurable), stakeholder sign-off status (weight: configurable)
- Score shall be on a 0–100 scale
- System shall generate a plain-English readiness report: score, breakdown by component, blocking items, recommended actions
- Configurable release threshold: default 85 (below threshold → blocked; above → approved)
- Score recalculates automatically when inputs change (test results, tickets, approvals)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Release with 2 open critical bugs scores below 85 and is blocked
- [ ] Resolving the critical bugs causes score to update within 60 seconds
- [ ] Readiness report lists each component's contribution to the score

---

### FR-CI-04: Changelog Generation
**Description:** Release changelogs are generated automatically from commits and closed tickets.

**User Story:**
> As a developer, I want the release changelog written automatically so I don't spend time on it before every release.

**Functional Requirements:**
- System shall collect: all commits since last release tag, all tickets closed since last release
- System shall classify each item as: user-facing feature, bug fix, performance improvement, security fix, internal/infrastructure (hidden by default)
- System shall generate changelog in two formats: technical (full commit + ticket detail) and user-facing (plain English summary of changes)
- Developer can edit the generated changelog before publishing
- Published changelog shall be stored and linked to the release record

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Generate changelog for a 10-commit release; output contains user-facing and technical sections
- [ ] Internal/infrastructure commits excluded from user-facing section by default
- [ ] Edited changelog saved and linked to release

## 9. Integration Specifications

### GitHub Integration
- **OAuth scopes required:** `repo`, `read:org`, `write:discussion`
- **Webhooks subscribed:** `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, `release`
- **Webhook secret:** HMAC-SHA256 validated on every event
- **Rate limit handling:** Respect GitHub's 5000 req/hour limit; queue requests with exponential backoff on 429

### OpenRouter Integration
- **Base URL:** `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Auth:** Bearer token (org-level API key stored in secrets vault)
- **Headers required:** `HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title` (for OpenRouter analytics)
- **Model IDs:** use OpenRouter format e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct`
- **Streaming:** SSE streaming supported and required for chat responses

### Ollama Integration
- **Base URL:** configurable per org (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`)
- **API:** OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- **Health check:** `GET /api/tags` — list available models before routing
- **On-prem verification:** requests to Ollama endpoint shall be logged as "on-prem" in audit trail

## 10. Security Requirements

### FR-SEC-01: API Key Management
- API keys shall be stored encrypted at rest (AES-256) in a secrets vault table
- Keys shall never be returned in API responses or logged in plaintext
- Keys shall be scoped: org-level (shared) and user-level (personal)
- Key rotation shall be supported without downtime

### FR-SEC-02: Audit Logging
- Every AI API call shall generate an audit log entry: user_id, project_id, model, input_token_count, output_token_count, cost, timestamp
- Audit logs shall be immutable (append-only; no update or delete)
- Audit logs shall be retained for minimum 90 days
- Audit logs shall be exportable as CSV for compliance

### FR-SEC-03: PII Scrubbing
- System shall support configurable PII scrubbing rules per org
- Before sending any prompt to a cloud provider, the system shall apply scrubbing rules
- Scrubbed items: email addresses, phone numbers, names (configurable), credit card patterns, government ID patterns
- Scrubbed content shall be replaced with placeholder tokens (e.g., `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`)

### FR-SEC-04: Role-Based Access Control
| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Org Admin | All permissions including billing, member management, model policy |
| Team Lead | Project settings, workflow publishing, backlog management |
| Developer | Sessions, skill activation, workflow execution, ticket creation |
| Stakeholder | Read-only backlog and release view, feedback submission |
| Billing | Billing and cost dashboard only |
