LoopForge is a **Product Engineering Intelligence** platform. It is not a coding assistant. It is the persistent brain your entire product engineering team thinks through — connecting business intent, architecture decisions, implementation, and quality outcomes into a single living graph.

## Features by Lifecycle Stage

### Spec
- **Spec-Driven Development** — generate PRDs, architecture docs, and technical specs via `POST /specs/:projectId/generate`
- **Approval workflows** — specs must be approved before downstream tasks are created
- **ADR extraction** — architectural decisions captured automatically from sessions; exportable as markdown
- **Eval generation** — approved specs can generate evaluation criteria from requirements automatically

### Code
- **Project Brain** — index a repo once; every session starts fully loaded with stack detection, conventions, and TODO surfacing
- **Context Packs** — curated context slices per task type (auth, database, API, UI, etc.) loaded at session start via `packId`
- **Capability Gap Advisor** — surfaces expertise gaps proactively (security, a11y, performance, testing, architecture, docs)
- **8 built-in skills** — `debug`, `security-audit`, `code-review`, `test-generation`, `ui-fix`, `plan-feature`, `explain`, `changelog`

### Design
- **Visual Context Engine** — upload a screenshot or paste a Figma URL; LoopForge analyzes UX issues, accessibility gaps, and copy problems, then links findings directly to source files
- **Design-to-code linking** — component names detected in visual analysis are matched against indexed code chunks
- **Multimodal sessions** — attach images directly to session messages; the frontier model reasons over code and visual context together

### Review
- **Multi-Agent Workflows** — PR review, bug investigation, release prep, nightly security scan
- **Intelligent Model Routing** — complexity-based tier selection: simple tasks → small model (Qwen 7B), code gen → medium, debugging/architecture → frontier
- **Data Classification Enforcement** — confidential/restricted projects automatically routed to on-prem Ollama; data never leaves your network
- **Eval Engine** — structured evaluation suites with AI scoring, human feedback capture, and regression detection
- **Engineering Goals** — set a high-level goal ("Ship Family Controls integration"), Claude decomposes it into sprint-ready tickets with dependency ordering; progress tracked as tickets resolve; blockers surfaced automatically

### Release
- **Epic Decomposer** — `POST /projects/:id/decompose` turns an epic description into sprint-ready tickets with file links pre-populated
- **AI-Maintained Backlog** — GitHub Issues integration, AI prioritization, health checks via `GET /backlog/tickets/:projectId`
- **GitHub Webhook** — live ticket sync on push/PR events via `POST /backlog/webhook/github`

### Learn
- **Product Engineering Knowledge Graph** — traversable graph connecting PRDs, requirements, specs, ADRs, code files, tickets, PRs, evaluations, and visual assets. Answer: "What breaks if this requirement changes?", "Which ADR approved this service?", "What led to this code existing?"
- **ADR Store** — all architectural decisions queryable and exportable per project
- **Cost Dashboard** — token usage and cost breakdown by session, project, and model in the UI
